**Bus-number!Is an app for Client-System course in my university.**

**The purpose of the app is to display 5 closest bus's arrival time for user's bus stop.**

If you interested in running this on localhost, then just clone this repo and run following commands:

```javascript
cd /client-server/client
npm install
npm run
```

And then activate backend(or vice versa):

```go
cd /client-server/server/
go run server.go
```
